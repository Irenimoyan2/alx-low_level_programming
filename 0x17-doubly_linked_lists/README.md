0. Print list
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Write a function that prints all the elements of a dlistint_t list.

Prototype: size_t print_dlistint(const dlistint_t *h);
Return: the number of nodes
Format: see example


1. List length
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)

Prototype: size_t dlistint_len(const dlistint_t *h);


2. Add node
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a dlistint_t list.

Prototype: dlistint_t *add_dnodeint(dlistint_t **head, const int n);
Return: the address of the new element, or NULL if it failed


3. Add node at the end

Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a dlistint_t list.

Prototype: dlistint_t *add_dnodeint_end(dlistint_t **head, const int n);
Return: the address of the new element, or NULL if it failed


4. Free list
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Write a function that frees a dlistint_t list.

Prototype: void free_dlistint(dlistint_t *head);


5. Get node at index
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Write a function that returns the nth node of a dlistint_t linked list.

Prototype: dlistint_t *get_dnodeint_at_index(dlistint_t *head, unsigned int index);
where index is the index of the node, starting from 0
if the node does not exist, return NULL


6. Sum list
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Write a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a dlistint_t linked list.

Prototype: int sum_dlistint(dlistint_t *head);
if the list is empty, return 0


7. Insert at index
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Write a function that inserts a new node at a given position.

Prototype: dlistint_t *insert_dnodeint_at_index(dlistint_t **h, unsigned int idx, int n);
where idx is the index of the list where the new node should be added. Index starts at 0
Returns: the address of the new node, or NULL if it failed
if it is not possible to add the new node at index idx, do not add the new node and return NULL
Your files 2-add_dnodeint.c and 3-add_dnodeint_end.c will be compiled during the correction


8. Delete at index
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Write a function that deletes the node at index index of a dlistint_t linked list.

Prototype: int delete_dnodeint_at_index(dlistint_t **head, unsigned int index);
where index is the index of the node that should be deleted. Index starts at 0
Returns: 1 if it succeeded, -1 if it failed


9. Crackme4
#advanced
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Find the password for crackme4.

Save the password in the file 100-password
Your file should contain the exact password, no new line, no extra space
Hint: The program prints “OK” when the password is correct


10. Palindromes
#advanced
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Save the result in the file 102-result
Your file should contain the exact result, no new line, no extra space


11. crackme5
#advanced
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Write a keygen for crackme5.

Usage of the crackme: ./crackme5 username key
The crackme will segfault if you do not enter the correct key for the user
Usage for your keygen: ./keygen5 username
Your keygen should print a valid key for the username
